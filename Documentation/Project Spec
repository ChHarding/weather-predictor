Project Spec – Weather App

General Description of the Weather Prediction App

The Weather Prediction App is a tool designed to provide users with accurate and real-time weather information, making it easier for them to plan their day and stay informed about upcoming weather conditions. The app will allow users to access current weather data, hourly and daily forecasts, and receive alerts for severe weather events. This information will be delivered in an accessible and user-friendly format, helping users make decisions related to travel, outdoor activities, and day-to-day planning. The project is intended to demonstrate how real-world data can be used effectively in applications, providing both practical benefits and educational insights.

The app will utilize data from an external weather API such as Open-Meteo, which provides real-time and forecast weather data. Using an external API enables the app to fetch accurate, location-based weather details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. It also opens up the possibility of adding historical weather data and severe weather alerts in the future. Along with Python for programming, the project will make use of the requests library to handle API requests and JSON to process the response data. The overall goal is to ensure that the weather data provided is as accurate and up to date as possible.

In terms of user interaction, the app will initially feature a command-line interface (CLI), allowing users to input the desired location and receive weather information directly in the terminal. This simplified interface is ideal for demonstrating the core functionality of the app without being distracted by interface design. However, in the future, a graphical user interface (GUI) could be developed using a framework like Tkinter, making the application more user-friendly and visually engaging. Additionally, the app could be extended to include a "remote control" feature, offering some form of API for other developers to integrate weather prediction into their own applications, or even provide notifications through email or messaging services.
 
Vignettes

Vignette 1: Enter Location
The user starts the app to check the weather forecast for a specific place. After launching the app, they are prompted to enter a location. The user types in the name of a city, such as "New York." The app processes the input, fetching the relevant geographic details, and provides a brief confirmation of the location that will be used. The user sees that the app has successfully retrieved the weather data for New York, indicating that they are ready to proceed with additional queries.

Technical Details:
•	The app uses a weather API to locate the city based on user input.
•	Error handling must be implemented in case the user enters an invalid or unrecognized location.
•	The API request includes the city name, but could also optionally include state or country to avoid ambiguity.
•	If using a CLI, the user should receive feedback for successful location matching or error messages if the location is not found.

Vignette 2: Enter Number of Days to Forecast
After entering the location, the user is prompted to specify how many days of weather forecast they would like to see. The user types "7" to see a week-long forecast for New York. The app acknowledges this input and displays a message indicating that it is retrieving weather data for the next 7 days. The response includes daily summaries with key metrics such as maximum and minimum temperatures, humidity, and an overall forecast summary (e.g., "partly cloudy" or "rainy").

 
Technical Details:
•	The app sends another request to the API, specifying the number of days (limited by the API's capabilities, usually between 1 to 16 days).
•	The request should include both the location and the forecast length parameters.
•	A loop might be used to format the output for each day, listing all key metrics for easy reading in the CLI.

Vignette 3: Select Hourly Weather Parameters
The user wishes to know specific details for a particular day in the forecast. They are given the option to select which weather parameters to view on an hourly basis, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The user chooses temperature and precipitation for a more detailed analysis. The app then retrieves the selected parameters, showing a breakdown of temperature and expected rainfall for each hour of the selected day.

Technical Details:
•	User input is used to select from available weather parameters (e.g., temperature, wind speed, precipitation).
•	The API request includes parameters for hourly weather, filtered based on user preference.
•	Data processing is done to display only the relevant weather parameters in an easy-to-read format.

Vignette 4: Show Interactive Plots of Parameters
After viewing the hourly details, the user is interested in visualizing this information. They select an option to create an interactive plot of temperature changes throughout the day. The app generates a simple line plot that shows temperature fluctuations from morning to evening, with labels for hours and temperature values. Additionally, the user has the option to interact with the plot by hovering over data points to see exact values at different times of the day.

 
Technical Details:
•	The app requires libraries like matplotlib or plotly to generate plots.
•	The data retrieved from the API is used as input to plot hourly temperature or other selected parameters.
•	Interactive plots can be implemented using plotly to allow the user to explore the data more deeply.

Vignette 5: Create a Table with Min, Mean, and Max for Each Day
To get a better overview of the forecast, the user selects an option to create a table summarizing the weather over the specified number of days. The app generates a table that displays the minimum, maximum, and mean temperature for each of the next 7 days in New York. This summary allows the user to quickly see trends, such as expected warming or cooling over the week.

Technical Details:
•	The daily weather data from the API is aggregated to calculate the minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures.
•	The pandas library can be used to structure the data and create the summary table.
•	The table is displayed in a readable format within the CLI, and can be saved as a CSV file for future reference.

Vignette 6: Highlighting Parts of the Plots Based on Thresholds
The user wants to easily identify potential hot days. They decide to highlight parts of the temperature plot where the temperature exceeds 80°F. The app takes the user's input and updates the plot, marking all areas where the temperature crosses the 80°F threshold in red. This makes it easy for the user to identify the hottest periods in the forecast visually.

Technical Details:
•	The threshold value (e.g., 80°F) is set by the user, and the app uses this value to determine which parts of the plot to highlight.
•	Conditional formatting is applied to the plot using a library like matplotlib.
•	The implementation involves segmenting the data based on the condition and plotting those segments with a different color.
